Hi there, I’m Josué Luiz Flamia / @Jhoushua

I am currently a Systems Development student at SENAI with a strong foundation in programming logic. 
My academic journey includes a year of Computer Engineering studies, and I have hands-on experience with C and Python. I am actively learning SQL, CSS, and HTML.

In addition to my studies, I work in support for a Systems company and have completed a year-long internship in IT. 
My experience extends to my military service, where I served as a Corporal. I have a keen interest in deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and Python.

I am involved in several projects and am working towards launching a company focused on developing security camera software. 
Balancing studies and work has been challenging, but I am dedicated to pursuing this goal.
